<h1>Hello, I'm Gilbert.</h1>
<small>
<p>Iâ€™m currently an undergrad studying EECS at UC Berkeley. My interests lie in the intersection of math, electrical engineering, and CS, specifically in probability and machine learning. I'm also curious about the implications of AI on society.</p>

<p>This summer, I interned at <a href="https://aws.amazon.com">Amazon Web Services</a>. Previously, I have worked at <a href="http://med.stanford.edu/snyderlab.html">Snyder Lab</a>.

<p>In my free time, my hobbies include basketball and lifting weights.</p>
