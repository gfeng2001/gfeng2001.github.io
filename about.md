<p>Iâ€™m Gilbert, a first-year EECS undergrad at UC Berkeley. My interests lie in the intersection of math, electrical engineering, and CS, specifically in combinatorics and machine learning. I'm also curious about the implications of AI on society.</p>

<p>In my free time, I like to lift weights, play Go, and shoot hoops.</p>
